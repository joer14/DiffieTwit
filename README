==[ Summary ]===========================================================

This program demonstrates the diffie hellmen key exchange system on the 
HC11. It uses Twitter to publically display all communications! Then you
can encrypt a message and have the HC11 decrpt it! 

==[ Files ]=============================================================

README         			This file.
Lab8_report.pdf			The procedure and findings of this 
				assignment.
lab8.asm			The assembly source code file.
alice.py			The Python script used by the computer 
				that is connected to the HC11.
pythpete.py			The Python script that runs on the
				other computer.

==How to Compile & Run ]================================================
First you must install all the dependencies needed for Python Twitter 
wrapper and for Python based serial communication. For Twitter you must
install simplejson, httplib2, python-oauth2. Setuptools is not required
however I recommend it. Then install the pyserial module. You can 
install all these modules from standard source by running their 
"setup.py" file with the commands "build" and then "install". You must
also sign up for a Twitter Dev account get 4 different tokens from 
Twitter to activate the python script. Modify the Alice and pypete
scripts accordingly or use our credentials if you like. 

Run the HC11 complier and point it towards the lab8.asm file. Then open 
up tera term and establish a connection with HC11. Type D and drag the 
binary file (.s19). Next press the "E" key to execute the program. After
uploading the code successfully connect the HC11 to the computer
running the "alice.py" script. Next start the py script on this computer
and start the pypete.py script on the other computer. After this you 
should be able to start the program by pushing the interupt button
on the HC11.


==[ Caveats & Additional Information ]==================================

The Twitter API will say that it failed to install because it is missing
some .json files but this isn't true. You should be fine without them.

==[ Quick Start Guide ]=================================================


Detail what your game is; is it a new twist on an old game? Or a 
completely new game? Be creative!

	The Diffie Hellmen key exchange is from was first publicly 
invented in 1976, so it is not new by anymeans. That being said I
believe this is first instance of the HC11 being used to implement the
Diffie Hellmen encryption scheme over Twitter.

How to Play? What are the controls? How do I play? What do I need to
press?
	Using the program is pretty simple and requires you press the 
interrupt button to generate a prime number. Then you enter a secret
key with the switches on the HC11 and press the interupt button to 
set it as a correct value. On the other side you input your values on
the python script via the keyboard. The rest of the program we will 
let you discover.

How do I win? What are the conditions? Do I have to get a certain 
number of things right? Do I need to beat a timer? Let me know!
	If you understand what we have done then you have won.

Secrets - Are there any hidden things in your game? Different game
modes, backdoors, etc?
	This project is full of secrets, but you get to come up with 
them. That's the best part!
